# Stripe Testing Payment Gateway
The stuff that should be known using this, are as follows,
* This API requires special keys ie. PublishableKey & SecretKey. Configure your key values in config.php.
* After completing the payment, A receipt will be generated (on the current page).
* No design is done (but customizable)!
